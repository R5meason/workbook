<h1>find middle of string</h1>

<p>Build a function, find_middle_letters, that finds the middle of a string. If the string is an odd number of characters,
it returns 1 letter. If it is an even number of characters, it returns 2 characters. It takes a string as a parameter
</p>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p>find_middle_letters('seven')</p>
<p>Return: 'v'</p>
<br>
<p>find_middle_letters('dish')</p>
<p>Return: 'is'</p>
